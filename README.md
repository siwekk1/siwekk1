## Hi there 👋

Polish beginner programmer on his way to get the first IT job

Before I started coding I spent 4 months to learning about linux, networking and computer science

I've tested many distros, but my favorite for its simplicity and reliability it's just Linux Mint/Ubuntu (cinnamon 🫶)

I don't like use commands that I don't know what they actually do I need to know how things work ✅

I've never participated in bootcamps and have not studied any IT-related subject, I am self-taught

I am particularly interested in backend/cybersecurity, I don't like frontend

Also before starting coding, I did research on the subject, now it's time to supplement it with practice

#### Fun facts:

* I've been a truck driver (Poland, Germany, Czech Republic)
* I love listening creepypastas
* Coffee addicted
* I'm trying to learn how to do pull-ups

See you 😎
